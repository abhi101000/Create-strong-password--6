## ✅ Analysis and Key Learnings

### 🔎 Observations:
- **Simple passwords** like `hello123` can be cracked in seconds.
- Adding **uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols** improves strength significantly.
- **Longer passwords** (16+ characters) provide much greater security and resistance to brute-force attacks.

### 🛡️ Best Practices:
- Use passwords with at least **12–16 characters**.
- Include a mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid common dictionary words and personal information.
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `Sky!Runs#Fast2025`) for memorability + strength.
- Consider using a **password manager** to generate and store complex passwords securely.
